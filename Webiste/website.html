                        <p style="text-align:justify">The introduction of virtual reality (VR) has made it possible to implement memory enhancement techniques such as the method of loci in a virtual setting (virtual memory palace). The studies into the virtual memory palace (VMP) have provided beneficial insight into how the memory palace can be applied to virtual environments (VEs). Moreover, these showcase the improvement in retention of the individuals after using the VMP. This thesis investigates whether a VE inspired by memory enhancement techniques can be used as a learning tool to teach employees at ING about GDPR compliances (specifically data privacy compliances). This study explored which memory enhancement techniques can be applied to the VE  and how they affect the memory process. To implement this study, we performed experiments on 23 participants out of which 12 were master students (with no prior knowledge of data privacy compliances) and 11 were ING employees. The experiment involved using the designed VE, performing one test and answering one questionnaire. The test was designed to check whether the participants were able to mark the location of the information found in the VE. The questionnaire was designed to test how the participants applied the information they saw in the VE. </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">Our results show that both the ING employees and the master students showed similar performance on the second questionnaire and shared similar preference on using the VE as a daily tool for learning. The performance in the first test wasn't 100% conclusive as some participants with low scores in the first questionnaire performed better in the second questionnaire. Using this VE, we were able to teach the participants some data privacy compliances. This thesis lays a foundation for applying VEs inspired by memory enhancement techniques in daily life situations.</p>

                            <h3>The environment used for this thesis was inspired by the following design principles:</h3>
                            <p>
                                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                    <li>The virtual environment (VE) includes elements such as placing information at a specific location in an environment (derived from the technique of memory palace) and surprising (and unsual) elements. All of these elements have proven to have a positive impact on retention of information.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        The environment was built as an island using pre-built assets (Lowpoly Tropical Island created by Brainbox) in Unreal engine.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The location of the information (10 data privacy guidelines) to be taught in the VE and the design of the VE were inspired by the <i>Ad herennium</i> guidelines because of its effectiveness in the memory palace technique.
                                        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                                            <li>The space should be solitary and not very crowded.</li>
                                            <li>Distance between loci should be at-least 10 meters.</li>
                                            <li>Having a unique sign every fifth loci.</li>
                                            <li>Avoid repetitive environments.</li>
                                            <li>The loci in a neither too spacious nor too narrow.</li>
                                            <li>The loci is not lighted too dark or too bright.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The VE used was not designed as a game but as an interactive environment with some game elements. So, it was important to understand and incorporate the use of different techniques in enhancing learning and engagement in serious games.</li>
                                    <li>Some game elements used in the VE design were collectibles and free flow movement. </li>
                                    <li>Some navigational techniques were used in designing the VE to help the users in navigating an unknown environment. One was the landmark technique (urban environment cue) that helps in providing the participant with a sense of orientation and direction in the environment. Another was trailblazing navigation technique (breadcrumb markers) which allows to spread the markers in way as to remember the path that was already visited.</li>
                                    <li>The VE also used 3-D sound to provide situation awareness and immersion into the environment</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                                At the begining of the thesis a literature study was conducted. This study provided an understanding of the memory process,
                                and the memory enhancement technqiues. Additonally, it provided information on how these techniques can be implemented in a virtual environment.
                                We also studied how GDPR (Global Data Protection Regulations) is implemented and translated. Also, what procedures are used to train the ING employees regarding these compliances.

                            <p>
                                After examining the chosen literature we devised the following research question:
                                <i>"Can a virtual environment (VE) where the design is inspired by the memory palace technique and the memory process be used as a learning tool? (exercises involving teaching about GDPR compliances specifically data privacy compliances)"</i>

                            <h3>Experiment</h3>
                            <p>
                                To answer the research question we devised an experiment which involved participants (11 ING employees and 12 master students) using the environment for 20 mins, followed by a distraction task (Sudoku puzzle) of 5 minutes.
                                Then the participants answered an environment recall test to determine how much of the information the participants were able to remember from the environment. This was followed by answering a questionnaire
                                where each question was derived from 10 guidelines used in the environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, a small discussion was conducted with each participant regarding their experience with the virtual environment
                                and their preference in using the environment as a replacement for the already existing training methods.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Results</h3>
                            <p>
                                From the results we saw that the participants from the higher ages performed poorly in the environment recall tests. Reasons could be low number of participants, general decrease in performance
                                with increasing age or even general lack of affinity towards VR. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some participants with low recall scores showed good co-relation between the checkpoints when they marked them in the test, despite marking them at the wrong locations. The results from the final
                                questionnaire suggested that there were signs of learning in the lower age groups (mainly the students) and for higher age groups (mainly the ING employees) the results were inconlusive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Both groups of participants enjoyed using the VE and prefered on using it again as a replacement to their existing training methods.
